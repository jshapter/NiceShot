# NiceShot

NiceShot was my dissertation project and served as an exercise in learning native Android development.
This ambitious first project was built on MVVM architecture using Kotlin, Compose & Room.

The aim here was to demonstarate OOP with Kotlin, build a UI with a modern design language (Material 3) and implement a relational database.

Users are able to create and edit an account as well as create image posts. The unique feature of this conceptual photo sharing platform is only allowing uploads from the user's device.
This was acheived through analysing image metadata and device information in order to validate images.
